Taylor, a neurosurgeon at SickKids, has found that if the cancer spreads, the metastases are genetically very similar to each other, but different from the primary tumour. Because oncologists assumed the metastasized cancer was genetically similar to that of the primary tumour, we all thought that treatments based on testing the primary tumour would impact all of the disease sites. Markers identified in the primary tumour may be missing entirely from the metastatic tumours, leaving those tumours untreated.\n",

       "Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that originates from astrocytes, which are star-shaped glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. These cells are part of the supportive tissue of the brain, and their primary function is to provide nutrients to the nervous tissue, maintain the blood-brain barrier, and repair the brain and spinal cord following traumatic injuries. Astrocytomas can occur in both adults and children, and they vary in their level of malignancy, ranging from low-grade (less aggressive) to high-grade (more aggressive) tumors.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Types of Astrocytomas:**\n",
       "1. **Pilocytic Astrocytoma (Grade I):** These are slow-growing tumors that are often considered benign and are more common in children and young adults. They are typically well-circumscribed and can often be treated successfully with surgery.\n",
       "   \n",
       "2. **Diffuse Astrocytoma (Grade II):** These tumors grow more slowly than higher-grade astrocytomas but can become more aggressive over time. They are infiltrative, meaning they spread into surrounding brain tissue, making complete surgical removal challenging.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Anaplastic Astrocytoma (Grade III):** These are malignant tumors that grow more rapidly and are more aggressive than lower-grade astrocytomas. They often require a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy for treatment.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Glioblastoma (Grade IV):** Also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), this is the most aggressive form of astrocytoma. It is highly malignant, grows rapidly, and has a poor prognosis. Treatment typically involves surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but the tumor often recurs.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Genetic Complexity and Treatment Challenges:**\n",
       "Recent research, as highlighted in a Reddit post from the r/science subreddit, indicates that astrocytomas can exhibit genetic differences between the primary tumor and its metastases. This genetic variability can complicate treatment, as therapies targeting the primary tumor may not be effective against metastatic sites. This underscores the importance of personalized medicine and the need for comprehensive genetic profiling of tumors to guide treatment decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Impact on Behavior:**\n",
       "Astrocytomas can also impact behavior and cognitive function, depending on their location in the brain. For instance, a historical case discussed on Reddit involved Charles Whitman, who had a tumor pressing on his brain, potentially influencing his behavior. This highlights the complex relationship between brain tumors and neurological symptoms.\n",
