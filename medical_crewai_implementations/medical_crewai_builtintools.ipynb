Astrocytomas are tumors that develop in your central nervous system (CNS) that grow from star-shaped astrocyte cells. They usually develop in your brain but can develop in your spinal cord as well. Astrocytomas can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Astrocytes are glial cells (the type of cells that provide supportive tissue in your brain). Other glial cells include oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells. Astrocytoma is the most common glioma . A glioma is a tumor that forms when glial cells grow out of control. Healthcare providers use grades to describe different types of astrocytomas. They don’t use a staging system as they do for many other types of cancer. What are the types of astrocytoma? Astrocytomas may be cancerous or noncancerous. The World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes astrocytomas into four grades. The grades depend on how fast astrocytomas grow and the likelihood that they’ll spread to (infiltrate) nearby brain tissue. Grade 1 astrocytomas are the mildest, while grade 4 astrocytomas are the most aggressive. Noncancerous astrocytomas Grade 1 astrocytomas, which are noncancerous, include: Pilocytic astrocytoma : This is a slow-growing tumor that doesn’t tend to spread. It’s the most common grade 1 astrocytoma. It’s benign and doesn’t require chemotherapy or radiation therapy after it’s surgically removed. Pilocytic astrocytomas most often develop in your cerebellum . Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma : This tumor usually grows slowly and most often develops in your temporal lobe . It often causes seizures. Surgery usually cures this type of brain tumor. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) : This tumor mainly develops in children who have tuberous sclerosis , a genetic condition. It grows inside ventricles, which are fluid-filled spaces deep in your brain. Surgery usually cures it. Advertisement Cancerous astrocytomas Cancerous astrocytomas include: Grade 2 astrocytomas : These astrocytomas tend to spread to nearby brain tissue. Because of this, surgery alone might not be enough to treat them. Grade 3 astrocytomas : These astrocytomas are more aggressive than grade 2 astrocytomas and often present as a progression from grade 2 astrocytomas. Surgery alone never cures these tumors. They require radiation and almost always require chemotherapy. Glioblastomas : These are grade 4 astrocytomas. They’re the most common form of astrocytoma and the most aggressive — they grow and spread rapidly. They can either present as a cancerous progression from a previously existing lower-grade astrocytoma (10% of cases) or begin as a grade 4 tumor (90% of cases). Who does astrocytoma affect? Astrocytomas can affect anyone, but different grades tend to affect people at different ages: Grade 1 astrocytomas most often affect children and teens. Astrocytomas, grade 2 most often affect adults between 20 and 60. Astrocytomas, grade 3 most often affect adults between 30 and 60. Glioblastoma (grade 4 astrocytoma) most often affects adults between 50 and 80. Grade 3 and 4 astrocytomas are more likely to affect adults assigned male at birth than adults assigned female at birth. How common is astrocytoma? Different grades of astrocytoma are more common than others: Grade 1 astrocytomas account for 2% of all brain tumors . Grade 2 astrocytomas account for 2% to 5% of all brain tumors. Grade 3 astrocytomas account for 4% of all brain tumors. Grade 4 astrocytomas (glioblastomas) account for 24% of all brain tumors. In adults, glioblastoma (grade 4 astrocytoma) is the most common type of brain cancer. Symptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of astrocytoma? The symptoms of astrocytoma can vary based on its size and location. Common symptoms include: Headaches . Nausea and vomiting . Seizures . Altered mental status , such as delirium or dementia . Memory loss . Other cognitive issues, such as personality changes or mood changes (like depression ). Fatigue. Vision problems. Speech problems ( aphasia or trouble speaking). Motor (movement) issues, such as abnormal reflexes or weakness. See a healthcare provider as soon as possible if you have these symptoms. What causes astrocytoma? Researchers don’t know the exact cause of most astrocytomas. The majority of these tumors are sporadic, meaning that they happen randomly. So far, researchers have only identified two known risk factors for astrocytomas: radiation exposure and genetics. However, recent studies have revealed that a mutation (change) in the IDH1 gene contributes significantly to the development of low-grade astrocytomas. This gene helps provide energy to your cells. Its mutation results in the production of a chemical called 2-HG, which, over time, builds up inside healthy astrocytes. This buildup causes the cells to become abnormal, causing astrocytomas. Advertisement Radiation exposure and astrocytomas Exposure to ionizing radiation, such as from radiation therapy , increases your risk of developing astrocytoma. For example, children who receive prophylactic (preventive) radiation for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) may be 22 times more likely to develop a central nervous system tumor, such as astrocytoma, within about five to 10 years. Genetics and astrocytomas The following rare genetic conditions are associated with the development of astrocytomas: Li-Fraumeni syndrome : This condition happens when something changes in your TP53 gene. People who have Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a 90% chance of developing one or more types of cancer in their lifetimes, which could include astrocytoma. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) : This condition causes abnormal increases in cell growth due to a mutation in a gene that’s supposed to suppress tumor growth. People with NF1 can develop early-onset astrocytomas, peripheral nerve tumors and spots on their skin called café-au-lait spots . Tuberous sclerosis : This condition causes a variety of medical issues, including epilepsy , developmental delay and tumors throughout your body. Tuberous sclerosis is caused by mutations in two genes: TSC1 and TSC2 . Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) typically only develop in people with tuberous sclerosis. Turcot syndrome : This condition results when there are mutations in several genes that suppress tumor growth. Turcot syndrome often involves growths ( polyps ) in your intestinal tract and one or more brain or spinal cord tumors, such as astrocytoma. Advertisement Diagnosis and Tests How are astrocytomas diagnosed? It can be difficult for healthcare providers to detect or suspect astrocytomas, as their symptoms are similar to other neurological conditions. Regardless, your provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. They’ll likely perform a neurological exam . This can help determine where in your brain or spinal cord the issue may be. Your provider may order a brain imaging test. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging test for finding and diagnosing astrocytoma. If you’re unable to have an MRI scan due to having a pacemaker or joint implant, a computed tomography (CT scan) is the next best option. If something abnormal appears on the brain imaging test, your provider will most likely recommend a biopsy or resection (tumor removal) to determine the diagnosis. Management and Treatment Is astrocytoma cancer curable? Surgery can cure most grade 1 astrocytomas if your neurosurgeon can safely remove the entire tumor. Very rarely, surgery may also cure some grade 2 astrocytomas. There’s no cure for grade 3 and grade 4 astrocytomas, as they grow and spread quickly. But radiation therapy and some medications can help slow their growth and help with symptoms. How is astrocytoma treated? Astrocytoma treatment depends on several factors, including: The tumor’s location, size and type. Your age. Your overall health. Advertisement Several specialists will work together to determine the best treatment plan for you. They may include: Neurologists . Neurosurgeons. Radiation oncologists . Medical oncologists. The main forms of treatment for astrocytomas are: Surgery. Radiation therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy . Tumor-treating fields (for glioblastomas). There may also be clinical trials that you can participate in. Surgery for astrocytomas Surgery is the first step in the treatment of astrocytomas. It provides three significant benefits: It allows your healthcare team to get tissue from the tumor to view it under a microscope to determine the exact type. Providers can perform additional tests on the tumor to look for proteins and mutations that certain medications could target. It offers the possibility to remove as much of the tumor as possible. This can help relieve pressure and prevent other issues in your brain and skull. Since grade 1 astrocytomas grow slowly and don’t spread to other areas of your brain, surgery is usually all it takes to treat them. Adjuvant therapies for astrocytomas Adjuvant therapy, sometimes called helper therapy, targets cancer cells that primary treatment didn’t destroy. In the case of astrocytomas, surgery is the primary treatment. Grade 3 and grade 4 astrocytomas always require treatments other than surgery alone. Grade 2 astrocytomas may sometimes require adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapies for astrocytomas include: Chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) : Chemotherapy involves medications that destroy cancer cells and/or prevent them from multiplying. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a drug that works by changing the DNA of tumor cells and, thus, causing the cells to die. TMZ is a first-line adjuvant therapy treatment for every grade 3 and grade 4 astrocytoma. Providers sometimes also prescribe it for grade 2 astrocytomas. Radiation therapy : This treatment uses radiation (usually high-powered X-rays) to kill cancer cells. It’s typically very effective in helping treat astrocytomas. Bevacizumab : This is an injected medication that prevents blood vessels from helping the tumor to grow. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastomas. It helps reduce swelling and can help improve symptoms. Tumor-treating fields : This is a special device that produces electrical fields that can delay tumor growth. You wear it like a helmet. Healthcare providers may recommend this treatment for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastomas. Care at Cleveland Clinic Glioma and Glioblastoma Treatment Find a Doctor and Specialists Make an Appointment Prevention Can I prevent developing astrocytoma? There’s nothing you can do to prevent developing astrocytoma. Most cases happen randomly. If you have a genetic condition that puts you at higher risk for astrocytoma, be sure to see your healthcare team regularly so they can monitor you for signs of astrocytoma. The earlier they can catch it, the better. Outlook / Prognosis What is the prognosis of astrocytoma? The prognosis (outlook) of astrocytoma depends on several factors, including: Tumor grade : The prognosis generally gets worse as the grade increases. How much of the tumor can be surgically removed : While grade 1 astrocytoma is usually cured with surgery alone, it’s impossible to completely remove grade 2 through 4 astrocytomas. However, the more tissue the neurosurgeon can remove, the better the survival rate. Use of adjuvant therapy : Adjuvant therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can help minimize symptoms and increase the survival rate. Age : In general, young age is associated with longer survival. Mental status : Minimal symptoms and normal neurological function are associated with longer survival. Your healthcare team will be able to give you more accurate information about what you can expect. Don’t be afraid to ask them questions. What is the survival rate of astrocytoma? The average survival rate varies depending on the grade of astrocytoma: Grade 1 (pilocytic astrocytomas) : More than 10 years. Grade 2 astrocytomas : More than five years. Grade 3 astrocytomas: About two to five years. Grade 4 (glioblastomas) : About a year. It’s important to remember that these are just averages based on large groups of people who’ve had astrocytoma. Your healthcare team can provide more detailed information about survival rates based on your unique situation. Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about astrocytoma? You may need follow-up appointments with neurologists, oncologists and neurosurgeons to make sure your treatment has worked or is continuing to work. Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible if you develop new or worsening symptoms, such as: Memory problems. Seizures. Severe headaches or vision problems. Unexplained weight loss . What questions should I ask my doctor? It may be helpful to ask your healthcare team the following questions: Why did I get astrocytoma? What kind of astrocytoma do I have? What’s the best treatment for me? What clinical trials am I eligible for? What are the treatment risks and side effects? What type of follow-up care do I need after treatment? What are the chances that the cancer will come back or spread after treatment? What signs of tumor growth should I look for? What signs of treatment complications should I look for? Are my family members at risk of developing astrocytoma? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between astrocytoma and glioblastoma? Glioblastoma is a type of astrocytoma — a grade 4 astrocytoma, specifically. Glioblastoma is an aggressive cancerous tumor that grows and spreads quickly. It’s the most common cancerous primary brain tumor. Is astrocytoma malignant or benign? There are several types of astrocytoma tumors — some are benign and some are malignant. Grade 1 astrocytomas are benign (noncancerous). Grades 2 through 4 are malignant (cancerous). A note from Cleveland Clinic Learning you have a tumor in your brain can be scary and stressful. Astrocytomas can vary in severity depending on the grade — some are benign and some are cancerous. Know that your healthcare team will develop an individualized and thorough treatment plan to help treat the astrocytoma and improve your quality of life.

      "Astrocytoma and glioblastoma are two types of brain tumors. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) changed how these tumors are classified.\n",
      "We asked neurosurgeon Chibawanye Ene, M.D., Ph.D. , to explain the different types of astrocytoma brain tumors, as well as how astrocytoma differs from glioblastoma.\n",
      "What is an astrocytoma?\n",
      "Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor . Astrocytoma brain tumors grow from astrocytes. An astrocyte is a type of cell in the nervous system. These cells get their name from their shape: they look like stars. Astrocytes help nerves work properly.\n",
      "Astrocytoma develops when astrocytes grow abnormally. It’s not known exactly what causes an astrocytoma to form. Certain genetic mutations are associated with astrocytes growing out of control and becoming tumors. Still, scientists are not sure exactly what causes abnormal astrocyte growth.\n",
      "Astrocytes are glial cells. Glial cells support the functions of the nervous system. Glial cells are found in the brain, spinal cord and elsewhere throughout the nervous system. Astrocytoma is a type of glioma (brain tumor).\n",
      "What are the types of astrocytoma?\n",
      "Astrocytomas are classified by the WHO from Grade 1 to Grade 4. Astrocytoma Grade 1 and astrocytoma Grade 2 are considered low-grade astrocytomas.\n",
      "Low-grade astrocytoma includes pilocytic astrocytoma (WHO Grade 1). Pilocytic astrocytoma usually occurs in children. It is not considered cancerous because it does not spread in the brain. Pilocytic astrocytoma is rare in adults.\n",
      "WHO Grade 2 astrocytoma tumors are also considered low-grade astrocytomas. But they grow faster than Grade 1 tumors and can affect more parts of the brain than Grade 1 astrocytomas. Grade 2 astrocytomas are more common among young adults.\n",
      "What’s a Grade 3 astrocytoma?\n",
      "Some low-grade astrocytomas progress to high-grade tumors (WHO Grade 3 or 4). Astrocytoma Grade 3 and astrocytoma Grade 4 are considered high-grade astrocytomas. High-grade tumors are fast-growing and aggressive.\n",
      "WHO Grade 3 astrocytoma usually affects adults. Previously, Grade 3 astrocytoma was called anaplastic astrocytoma. Recently, the WHO revised its terminology. The term “anaplastic” is no longer used. Instead, these tumors are simply called Grade 3 astrocytomas.\n",
      "Is Grade 4 astrocytoma the same as glioblastoma?\n",
      "Until recently, glioblastoma was considered a Grade 4 astrocytoma brain tumor—the most aggressive astrocytoma.\n",
      "Today, however, glioblastoma and astrocytoma are classified based on the presence or absence of a mutation in an enzyme called isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH).\n",
      "Astrocytomas are all IDH-mutant tumors. This means they have a mutation in their IDH enzyme.\n",
      "Glioblastomas are all IDH-wild-type because they do not have IDH mutations.\n",
      "Glioblastoma has a different molecular profile than Grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytoma. Therefore, glioblastoma is no longer believed to evolve from a lower-grade astrocytoma. Still, both glioblastoma and Grade 4 astrocytoma are aggressive, cancerous tumors.\n",
      "How do doctors know if a tumor is IDH-wild-type or IDH-mutant?\n",
      "A doctor removes the tumor to biopsy it. Then, scientists run lab tests to determine whether the tumor is IDH-wild-type or IDH-mutant.\n",
      "What are the signs and symptoms of astrocytoma?\n",
      "Signs and symptoms of astrocytoma include headaches, blurry or double vision, seizures, trouble with balance and coordination, and mood changes.\n",
      "What causes astrocytomas?\n",
      "The precise causes are not known. Astrocytoma may be associated with certain genetic risk factors. Some hereditary syndromes, like Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Turcot syndrome, and von Hippel-Landau disease, may be connected to astrocytoma.\n",
      "How is astrocytoma treated?\n",
      "Astrocytoma is difficult to treat because the tumors are mixed with healthy tissue in the brain. The higher the grade of the tumor, the more likely that surgery will be accompanied by medication and radiation.\n",
      "Grade 1 astrocytoma brain tumors, if completely removed by surgery, do not need additional treatments. Grade 2 astrocytoma may be treated with both surgery and chemotherapy. Whether radiation is used depends on factors such as age and how much tumor is left after surgery.\n",
      "Grade 3 astrocytoma and Grade 4 astrocytoma brain tumors usually require surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. That’s because these high-grade tumors spread within the brain and cannot be completely removed by surgery. Therefore, after surgery, chemotherapy and radiation are used to kill the tumor cells that spread outside of the area of surgery.\n",
      "Today, we have more treatment options than ever before to manage astrocytoma. Modern surgical procedures enable surgeons to be more precise and effective when they remove tumors. Techniques like fluorescence-guided surgery and brain mapping also allow surgeons to more precisely target areas of the brain during surgery, minimizing impact on healthy areas.\n",
      "In some cases, we can use radiation therapy instead to treat tumors without surgically opening the skull. For patients who don’t respond to radiation therapy, we can use laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) to kill the tumor.\n",
      "MD Anderson is also testing next-generation brain tumor treatments through clinical trials . These treatments include using viruses or natural killer T-cells to destroy cancer cells. Results from these clinical trials will help determine whether these therapies can become part of the standard treatment for brain tumors.\n",

      "The brain is made up by many different cells, including neurons, which constitute the electric circuitry responsible for brain functions, and astrocytes, which provide the structure and support for neurons to work properly. Astrocytomas are tumors which originates from astrocytes, and, in adult individuals, they are the most common brain tumors. In the US, about 15,000 new astrocytomas are diagnosed every year. Males are slightly more affected than females, with a ratio of 1.3/1.\n",

      "Tumor Grading and its Meaning\n",
      "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications of brain tumors, astrocytomas range from grade 1 (most benign) to grade 4 (most malignant). This grading, which is made by analyzing the tumor cells under the microscope is based on the following features: 1) how abnormal the cells look like (atypia); 2) how much they grow (mitosis); 3) presence of newly made blood vessels within the tumor (vascular proliferation). This is further integrated by the analysis of tumor’s genetic features, i.e. the DNA analysis of the tumor cells. Generally, with the exception of grade 1 tumors, which are most common in the pediatric population, most astrocytomas affect patients older than 40. Also, the older the patient, the higher the chances of the astrocytoma to be of higher grade.\n",
      "Grade 1\n",
      "Pilocytic Astrocytoma is a well circumscribed tumor and grows slowly. Most common in the cerebellum, i.e. the part of the brain located in the back of the head, just above the neck. It does not invade into the surrounding brain, thus when resected completely it is considered cured, and it does not require either chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\n",
      "Pleomorphic Xantoastrocytoma most frequently originates in the temporal lobes and is commonly associated with seizures. Its cells can have many different shapes (pleomorphic), but usually do not show evidence of proliferation. Surgery is usually curative.\n",
      "Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA) is most common in the younger population, usually in association with a familiar syndrome called tuberous sclerosis. It characteristically grows inside the ventricles, which are fluid-filled spaces deep into the brain, and can often block the normal outflow of this fluid, thus causing hydrocephalus. Surgical resection is usually curative.\n",
      "Grade 2\n",
      "Diffuse Astrocytoma is an invasive tumor, so there is no clear separation from the surrounding brain, and surgery itself might not be enough for its cure (this depends on several other factors described below). The tissue appearance is only moderately different from a normal brain, but cells appear abnormal under the microscope and slightly increased in number.\n",
      "Grade 3\n",
      "Anaplastic Astrocytoma is considered a more malignant evolution of a previously lower grade astrocytoma, which has acquired more aggressive features, including a higher pace of growth and more invasion into the brain. Histologically, it displays a higher degree of cellular abnormalities, and evidence of cell proliferation (mitoses), in comparison to grade 2 tumors. Surgery is never considered curative for these tumors, and needs to be followed by radiation and almost always chemotherapy.\n",
      "Grade 4\n",
      "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant, aggressive and common (60%) form of astrocytomas. Histologically, it is characterized by very abnormal-appearing cells, proliferation, areas of dead tissue and formation of new vessels. GBM can present either as a malignant progression from a previously existing lower grade astrocytoma (usually in 10% of cases) or originate directly as a grade 4 tumor (90% of cases). The former scenario is most common in younger patients, while the latter is most common after age 60. Regardless of its presentation, this tumor is a highly aggressive cancer, with pronounced brain invasion and destruction and very fast progression.\n",

      "Important Biological Features\n",
      "Over the past 15 years, there have been important strides in understanding this disease, mainly derived from significant advances in the ability to study its genetic and biologic underpinnings\n",
      "IDH1 mutation is a fundamental feature that characterizes a subgroup of astrocytomas with mutation of a gene, called isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). This gene is involved in providing energy to the cells. Its mutation results in production of a chemical called 2-HG, which, over time, builds up inside the normal astrocytes and set them astray, causing astrocytomas. More than just another laboratory finding, this mutation is crucial because it characterizes almost 100% of low grade astrocytomas and is associated with significantly\n",
      "MGMT silencing has to do with the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) enzyme involved in repairing DNA after it has been damaged by chemotherapics, thus protects the tumor against the action of these drugs. Certain astrocytomas have this enzyme turned off, and, as a result, they respond significantly better to chemotherapy with TMZ.\n",
      "Immunologic escape means that tumors escape the patrolling immune system, which normally destroys anything that is recognized as “abnormal”. Astrocytomas are among the tumors with the most developed ability to escape this surveillance. They do this by activating multiple genes that can turn the immune system off. There is consensus that counteracting this immune escape will result in important therapeutic benefits.\n",
      "Risk Factors\n",
      "Astrocytomas are, for the vast majority, sporadic tumors, meaning that they happen by chance, or at least, it is not yet known why these occur. There are only two situations with proven evidence to cause the tumor:\n",
      "Hereditary syndromes (i.e. caused by inherited DNA mutations):\n",
      "Li-Fraumeni: due to mutation in tumor suppressor gene p53 and characterized by young onset of multiple tumors, including breast cancer, bone cancers, leukemias and astrocytomas.\n",
      "Turcot : due to mutations in several tumor suppressor genes, including APC and MMR and characterized by early onset of colon cancer and astrocytomas.\n",
      "Neurofibromatosis 1: due to mutation of tumor suppressor NF1, responsible for early onset of astrocytomas, peripheral nerve tumors, skin freckling and light-brown patches in the skin.\n",
      "Tuberous sclerosis: is a rare genetic disorder associated with mental retardation and early onset of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA).\n",
      "Environmental:\n",
      "Ionizing radiations: exposure to ionizing radiations has been associated to delayed onset of astrocytomas. Individuals at particular risk are those exposed to therapeutic radiotherapy to the head and neck region during childhood (i.e. for treatment of leukemias or other brain tumors). The interval between exposure to radiation and astrocytoma onset can be as long as 20-30 years.\n",
      "Warfare chemicals: There is a yet unproven suspicion that exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War might be responsible for delayed onset of astrocytomas in veterans.\n",
      "Cellular phones: despite some suspicions, particularly related to heavy use, there is no data supporting a causative risk for astrocytomas.\n",
      "SYMPTOMS + TYPES\n",
      "The clinical presentation of astrocytomas depends much more on their location within the brain, rather than their biologic characteristics. There are regions of the brain that can accommodate very large tumors before they become symptomatic (for example, the regions in the forehead), while there are other locations where even a small tumor can cause problems early on, like limb weakness or difficulty with speech or vision.\n",
      "Generally, low grade astrocytomas tend to be of bigger size before they become symptomatic, as compared to more aggressive, higher grade astrocytomas. This is because lower grade tumors tend to displace the brain rather than destroying it, and also because they are associated with less brain swelling than malignant ones.\n",
      "Common symptoms of astrocytomas are the following:\n",
      "Persistent headaches\n",
      "Headaches which are worse in the morning or cause awakening from sleep ( a sign of increased intracranial pressure)\n",
      "Double or blurred vision\n",
      "Speech problems\n",
      "Decreased cognitive abilities\n",
      "Grasp or limb weakness\n",
      "New seizures\n",
      "TESTING + DIAGNOSIS\n",
      "Diagnostic Imaging\n",
      "Conventional MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most important imaging study for astrocytomas. Usually, images are acquired both before and after the administration of IV contrast. As a rule of thumb, if the tumor picks up the contrast (i.e. becomes bright on images), it is an indication of a higher grade astrocytoma.\n",
      "Other imaging sequences provides clues as to tumor cellularity, brain swelling and brain infiltration.\n",
      "Axial T1-weighted MRIs after IV gadolinium administration: Low grade tumors usually do not take contrast (left panel), while grade 4 tumors display strong contrast enhancement and frequent central necrosis (right panel)\n",
      "MRI spectroscopy (MRS): It is an imaging tool, based on MRI, which provides information on the chemical composition of the tumor, and works based on the fact that certain chemicals are abundant in the normal brain (for example, NAA), while others are abundant in tumors (for example, choline). The output of this imaging modality is a diagram showing the amount of each chemical in the area of the brain under analysis: If the amount of NAA is more than choline, that suggests a normal brain (see below). The opposite raises suspicion of a tumor. This technique can be considered as a non-invasive tissue sampling, although it is not as accurate or definitive as a standard biopsy.\n",
      "MRI spectroscopy of normal brain (sampled voxels are represented on the right side of the panel). The NAA peak is the most prominent\n",
      "Functional MRI (fMRI): fMRI is a useful technique to visualize in real time which parts of the brain become activated when the patient is asked to perform a certain task (for example talking, or moving one arm or leg). This is fundamental to define the regions of the brain which, if damaged, would cause problems to the patient. Activated brain is shown as a yellow/red signal (see figure below) superimposed to an otherwise standard MRI. For tumors that are localized in the proximity of critical areas (speech centers, motor cortex or visual cortex) fMRI provide an important adjunct, particularly in regards to surgical planning.\n",
      "fMRI with BOLD imaging during object naming. The yellow/red BOLD signal displays significant activation in the left temporo-parietal region, in the expected anatomical area for language production, and in close proximity to the location of a glioblastoma\n",
      "TREATMENT + CARE\n",
      "Surgery\n",
      "Surgery is the first step for the treatment of astrocytomas, as it provides two important benefits: First, it procures tumor tissue to establish a diagnosis. Secondly, it offers the possibility to remove as much tumor is safely possible to relieve mass effect, reduce swelling and facilitate response to adjuvant therapies, when indicated. The decision whether to perform a simple biopsy or a full resection depends on multiple factors, but particularly on the clinical and medical conditions of the patient, as well as the predicted extent of resectability of the tumor.\n",
      "Important tools to maximize efficiency and safety of surgery are:\n",
      "Neuronavigation: it is, in essence, a GPS system for the brain, and allows the surgeon to visualize in real time on the MRI his/her localization within the patient’s brain. This significantly increases precision and minimizes the risk of injuring normal brain.\n",
      "Awake surgery: This technique is particularly useful to resect tumors located in speech areas, and also when close to primary motor cortex bilaterally. The patient is kept sedated but not intubated, so that he/she can speak and execute commands when asked to. In this way, the surgeon can continuously asses the patient’s functions while removing the tumor.\n",
      "Motor mapping during general anesthesia: The regions of the brain controlling movement can be also stimulated with an electrode even if the patient is asleep. A stimulator is used to apply currents directly to the brain cortex, and muscle responses are recorded.. Positive responses are interpreted as brain structures that should be spared from resection.\n",
      "Fluorescent dyes: Tumors, particularly those of higher grade, have the characteristic to avidly absorb certain dyes that are given IV to the patient just before surgery. In this way, the tumor tissue becomes colored by the specific dye, while the normal brain does not. This allows a much more precise definition of what should be resected and what should be left untouched. Among the most reliable dyes are 5-ALA, which colors the tumor violet, and Fluoresceine, which colors the tumor yellow, when visualized with appropriate lenses (see below)\n",
      "Intraoperative imaging of a recurrent high grade astrocytoma. Under white light (upper panel A) the tumor and necrotic portions are not clearly distinguishable. Under the blue-450 nm filter (lower panel A), the non-fluorescent darker portion represents radiation necrosis, while the bright magenta-pink fluorescence represents tumor tissue uptaking 5-ALA.\n",
      "In another patient (panel B), the tumor is readily visible as a bright yellow-green hue after administration of fluoresceine and imaging with a 560 nm yellow filter\n",
      "Established adjuvant therapies\n",
      "Steroids: Dexamethasone is the drug of choice to relieve symptoms due to the brain swelling that is often associated to the tumor. It is a very effective drug, which acts quickly and reliably. Unfortunately, it does not have any action against the tumor, and it is associated to significant side effects when used for periods longer than 2-3 weeks: weight gain, high blood sugars, hypertension, increased risk of infection, irritability.\n",
      "Chemotherapy with TMZ : Temozolomide (TMZ) is a drug which is taken by mouth and works by slightly modifying the DNA of tumor cells . This effect on the DNA triggers its breakage and consequent death of the cell, unless DNA repair mechanisms override the damage. TMZ is by now a well established first line treatment for every astrocytoma which is either grade 3 or 4 and is occasionally used also for grade 2 tumors (when they are not completely resected in surgery or if their genetic analysis is not favorable). It is usually taken daily for 5 days, followed by a rest period of 3 weeks, before starting another cycle. Side effects are rather bland, but it has been associated with anemia and fatigue. It is possible to predict the sensitivity of the astrocytoma to TMZ by measuring the activity of the MGMT gene, which is able to repair the damage induced by TMZ, and thus neutralizes the therapeutic effect of the drug.\n",
      "Radiotherapy: Radiation has been at the basis of treatment of astrocytomas for the past 50 years and it is extremely effective, at least for the first few months after treatment. Radiation, too, works by damaging DNA of the tumor cells, thus inducing their death. Under standard protocols, the treatment consists of small doses of radiation in the area of the tumor, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Side effects are local hair loss (usually temporary), and fatigue. Long term side effects are necrosis of the brain around the treated region, and cognitive difficulties.\n",
      "Bevacizumab (Avastin): Bevacizumab is a drug that blocks the tumor’s ability to recruit blood vessels so that they can feed themselves and keep growing. Avastin has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 for its use in recurrent glioblastomas. It is very effective in reducing the swelling associated with the tumor and often helps improving symptoms. In this sense, it functions as a potent alternative to steroids. Unfortunately, differently from radiation and TMZ, it does not significantly prolong survival.\n",
      "Tumor treating electrical fields In 2011, the FDA approved the use of a special device applied to the scalp as a helmet, which produces low current electric fields which have been proved to delay tumor growth. They can be used both for recurrent glioblastomas, and, since 2015, also for newly diagnosed glioblastomas. For this device to be helpful, it needs to be worn at least 18 hours every day. Side effects are minimal and mainly consist of skin irritation.\n",
      "Antiseizure Drugs : Levetiracetam (Keppra) is the most widely used drug for this purpose. It is usually reserved only for patients that have already experienced at least one seizures.\n",
      "Experimental Therapies\n",
      "Astrocytomas, and in particular glioblastomas, are the target of intense research and every year several clinical trials are conducted to find new strategies which would improve survival. The most intense field of investigations are the following:\n",
      "Targeted therapies: Nowadays, the majority of treating centers perform detailed genetic analysis of any tumor tissue removed at surgery, in order to obtain patient-specific molecular signatures which can help establish the best drug for that tumor.\n",
      "Immunotherapy: A weakened immune surveillance is fundamental for the development and progression of astrocytomas. For this reason a large effort is currently underway to find strategies to boost the immune system against the tumor. This is being currently investigated with the use of antitumor vaccines, the use of genetically modified immune cells which are administered to the patient by intravenous infusion, or the use of drugs which stimulate the immune system activation.\n",
      "Virus therapy: A promising and ever expanding approach is the use of viruses which, once administered to patients (usually directly injected by the neurosurgeon into the tumor), can selectively infect and destroy tumor cells without harming the surrounding normal brain. Historically, the first virus to be investigated extensively has been Herpes Simplex (the cold sore virus). Recently, some encouraging results have been observed with the use of Poliovirus, even though the benefit was only observed in a small percentage of patients.\n",
      "Prognosis\n",
      "The major factors determining length of survival after a diagnosis of astrocytoma are the following:\n",
      "Tumor grade/histology\n",
      "Grade 1 tumors are largely cured (96% survival rate at 5 years), usually by surgery only.\n",
      "Grade 2 tumors: Overall median survival is 8 years. Presence of IDH1 mutation is associated with longer survival.\n",
      "Grade 3 tumors: Median survival is 3-5 years\n",
      "Grade 4 tumors: Median survival is 15 months.\n",
      "Extent of surgical resection: Although complete microscopic resection of grade 2-4 tumors is impossible due to their diffuse infiltration into the normal brain, macroscopically total resection is associated with significantly better survival. For GBM, an increase in survival is observed after at least 80% of tumor is resected and there is a stepwise improvement in prognosis as the extent of resection reaches the 95-100% of the contrast-enhancing component.\n",
      "Use of adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n",
      "Age: young age is associated with longer survival.\n",
      "Functional status: minimal symptoms/normal neurological function are associated with longer survival.\n",

      "Home  /  Tumor Type  / Astrocytoma (Adult-type)\n",
      "Astrocytoma (Adult-type)\n",
      "Astrocytomas are tumors that arise from astrocytes—star-shaped cells that make up the “glue-like” or supportive tissue of the brain. Many astrocytomas are slow growing and tend to invade surrounding tissues. These tumors are called “diffuse” because it is difficult to tell where the tumor begins and ends. Other kinds of astrocytomas (e.g., pilocytic astrocytoma) are more circumscribed, meaning that there is a sharper border between the tumor and surrounding brain. Diffuse astrocytomas are classified into adult-type and pediatric-type tumors. Astrocytomas may be either IDH-mutant or non-mutant (a.k.a. wildtype). IDH-mutant astrocytoma is divided into three grades (2, 3, or 4) with higher grades associated with more rapid growth and recurrence. IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytomas may be classified as glioblastoma if they have other microscopic and genetic features of glioblastoma Circumscribed astrocytomas are also IDH-wildtype, although they tend to be less aggressive than either IDH-wildtype or IDH-mutant diffuse astrocytomas.\n",
      "Location\n",
      "Astrocytomas can appear in various parts of the brain and nervous system, including the cerebellum, cerebrum, brainstem, spinal cord, and central areas of the brain. They most commonly develop in the frontal or temporal lobes.\n",
      "Symptoms\n",
      "Common signs of an astrocytoma are seizures, headaches, and personality changes. Other symptoms may include weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, or changes related to thinking, learning, concentrating, problem-solving, and decision-making. Symptoms will vary by location and size of the tumor.\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "If the tumor is located in a surgically accessible part of the brain, the usual treatment for astrocytomas is removal of as much of the tumor as possible. Depending on the kind of astrocytoma, surgery may be the only treatment that is needed. If a tumor is in a location that is unsafe for surgical removal, biopsy is usually done to confirm the diagnosis and help guide treatment. If some of the tumor remains (also called “residual” tumor), or if the tumor has molecular characteristics that suggest it may be more likely to recur, radiation therapy may be recommended following surgery. Radiation therapy generally takes place over the course of a six-week time period and may be given along with chemotherapy. Depending upon the amount of tumor that is not able to be removed (residual tumor) and the molecular characteristics of the tumor itself, chemotherapy or targeted therapy may be suggested to treat the remaining tumor. Chemotherapy may be administered via a pill or an intravenous injection. Vorasidinib, a targeted therapy, was recently approved by the FDA to treat grade 2 astrocytomas with IDH mutations. This medication, taken once daily, has been shown to slow tumor regrowth. Regular MRI scans are recommended following the diagnosis of astrocytoma, generally at least once per year. Patients with seizures will need to be followed for their seizure medication. A recurring astrocytoma may be treated with surgery, particularly when the time between initial diagnosis and recurrence is extended. In this way, the diagnosis can be updated to reflect any molecular changes in the tumor that may have occurred over time as the tumor adapts to treatments. Recurrent astrocytomas may also be treated with radiation therapy, depending on whether or how much radiation was given after the original diagnosis. Chemotherapy/immunotherapy and clinical trials are additional options.\n",
      "Prognosis\n",
      "Prognosis means a prediction of outcome. This information is usually based on information gathered from groups of people with the same disease. It is important to remember these statistics are not individualized. The proportion of patients by age group who are still alive 5 years after a diagnosis of diffuse astrocytoma are as follows: Children (ages 0-14): 82.4% Adolescents and Young Adults (ages 15-39): 78.2% Adults (ages 40+): 34.0%\n",
      "Incidence\n",
      "Adult astrocytomas are estimated to account for 3.5% of all primary brain tumors with approximately 1,500 new diagnoses in the United States each year.\n",
      "Age Distribution\n",
      "Diffuse astrocytomas most often occur between the ages of 20-60 with a median age at diagnosis of 46 years for lower grade lesions and 54 years for higher grade lesions. Although these tumors are found in both men and women, they tend to occur more often in men.\n",
      "Risk Factors\n",
      "Although all tumors (including astrocytoma) are caused by genetic changes, the exact cause of most astrocytomas is not known. Exposure to radiation and certain gene changes that can be passed down through families have been linked to a higher chance of developing gliomas.\n",
      "Molecular Profile\n",
      "Molecular profiling is the detection of specific genes, proteins, or other molecules in a tumor. This information helps confirm tumor diagnosis, inform treatment options, and predict prognosis. Among adult-type diffuse astrocytomas, IDH-mutant astrocytomas are a type of glioma that have mutations in either IDH1 or, less commonly, IDH2. Other genes, like ATRX and TP53, are often mutated alongside IDH1 or IDH2. If a gene called CDKN2A/B is completely lost, the IDH mutant astrocytoma is automatically grade 4 regardless of what it looks like under the microscope. If an IDH-wildtype astrocytoma has other genetic changes in genes like TERT and EGFR , as well as gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10, the tumor is automatically a glioblastoma , IDH-wildtype, grade 4. The genetics of circumscribed astrocytomas are more complicated and can be discussed with your physician.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Cleveland Clinic**: \n",
      "   - Astrocytomas are tumors that develop in the central nervous system, primarily in the brain and sometimes in the spinal cord. They originate from star-shaped astrocyte cells. Astrocytomas can be benign or malignant and are categorized into four grades by the World Health Organization. Treatment often involves surgery, and the prognosis varies based on the tumor grade and other factors. [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17863-astrocytoma)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MD Anderson Cancer Center**:\n",
      "   - Astrocytomas are brain tumors that arise from astrocytes. They are classified from Grade 1 to Grade 4, with higher grades being more aggressive. The classification has been updated to consider genetic mutations, such as IDH mutations. Treatment typically involves surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, with newer therapies being explored in clinical trials. [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/what-is-astrocytoma--and-how-is-it-different-from-glioblastoma.h00-159694389.html)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)**:\n",
      "   - Astrocytomas are the most common brain tumors in adults, originating from astrocytes. They are graded from 1 to 4, with glioblastoma being the most aggressive form. Treatment includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, with ongoing research into genetic and immunological therapies. [AANS](https://www.aans.org/patients/conditions-treatments/astrocytoma-tumors/)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **American Brain Tumor Association (ABTA)**:\n",
      "   - Astrocytomas arise from astrocytes and can be diffuse or circumscribed. They are classified based on genetic mutations and tumor grade. Treatment involves surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, with regular monitoring through MRI scans. Prognosis depends on various factors, including age and tumor genetics.

      "An astrocytoma is a type of tumor that develops in the central nervous system, primarily affecting the brain and occasionally the spinal cord. These tumors originate from astrocytes, which are star-shaped glial cells that support nerve cells. Astrocytomas can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and are classified into four grades by the World Health Organization, with Grade 1 being the least aggressive and Grade 4 being the most aggressive, known as glioblastoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "The classification of astrocytomas has evolved to include genetic factors, such as IDH mutations, which play a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment planning. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Newer therapies, including genetic and immunological approaches, are being explored in clinical trials to improve outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prognosis for individuals with astrocytoma varies significantly based on the tumor's grade, genetic characteristics, and other factors such as the patient's age and overall health. Regular monitoring through MRI scans is often necessary to track the tumor's progression and response to treatment.\n",
