      "Content: Astrocytoma | UCSF Brain Tumor Center Astrocytoma is a brain tumor arising from astrocytes, which are supportive cells in the brain and spinal cord. Because astrocytes are a type of glial cell, astrocytomas are a specific type of glioma (tumors that arise from glial cells). First, astrocytomas can be classified by grade, which is a measure how abnormal the tumor cells look, and how quickly they grow. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are relatively rare tumors that primarily occur in people with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a rare genetic condition that predisposes patients to develop tumors throughout the body. Anaplastic astrocytomas have “anaplastic” features, meaning that the tumors extend tentacle-like projections of cells that grow into neighboring tissue.\n",

       "Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that originates from astrocytes, which are star-shaped glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is a subtype of glioma, a category of tumors that arise from glial cells. Astrocytomas are classified based on their grade, which reflects how abnormal the tumor cells appear under a microscope and how quickly they are likely to grow.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Classification and Grades:**\n",
       "Astrocytomas are categorized into different grades, which help determine the treatment approach and prognosis:\n",
       "- **Grade 1 (Pilocytic Astrocytoma):** These are often considered benign and are slow-growing. Surgery can often cure these tumors if they can be completely removed.\n",
       "- **Grade 2 (Diffuse Astrocytoma):** These are low-grade tumors that grow slowly but can become more aggressive over time.\n",
       "- **Grade 3 (Anaplastic Astrocytoma):** These tumors are malignant and grow more rapidly, often requiring additional treatments beyond surgery.\n",
       "- **Grade 4 (Glioblastoma):** This is the most aggressive form of astrocytoma, known for rapid growth and a poor prognosis.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Symptoms:**\n",
       "The symptoms of astrocytoma can vary depending on the tumor's location and size. Common symptoms include:\n",
       "- Headaches\n",
       "- Seizures\n",
       "- Nausea and vomiting\n",
       "- Personality changes\n",
       "- Neurological deficits such as weakness or sensory changes\n",
       "\n",
       "**Causes and Risk Factors:**\n",
       "While the exact cause of astrocytomas is not fully understood, certain genetic conditions, such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), can increase the risk of developing these tumors. Environmental factors and genetic mutations may also play a role.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Diagnosis and Treatment:**\n",
       "Diagnosis typically involves imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans, followed by a biopsy to determine the tumor's grade. Treatment options depend on the tumor's grade and location and may include:\n",
       "- Surgery: Often the first step to remove as much of the tumor as possible.\n",
       "- Radiation therapy: Used to target and kill remaining cancer cells.\n",
       "- Chemotherapy: May be used in conjunction with radiation, especially for higher-grade tumors.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Prognosis:**\n",
       "The prognosis for astrocytoma varies widely based on the tumor's grade and the patient's overall health. Lower-grade tumors generally have a better prognosis, while higher-grade tumors like glioblastomas are more challenging to treat effectively.\n",
